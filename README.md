# Express-Note-Taker

# Description 
the goal of this application was to create a note taker utilizing javascript, npm, node.js and express. I learned how to utilize express.js to make a localhost server that I posted through heroku. I was able to see how using app.get and app.post that I could pull different files and generate a front end page through the server. I had difficulties with having the fs.Writefile create the file when I did the post method. I also had difficulties with being able to use the get method to pull saved files from the db.json that were created.
